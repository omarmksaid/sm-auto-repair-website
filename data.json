I have recommended SM Auto to other friends as well and they like the service and the pricing. These guys are the best and they're nice people too.",

Phong, the owner, has consistently demonstrated professionalism and integrity, qualities that are paramount for us. In an industry where many shops upsell unnecessary repairs or exaggerate issues to push for full replacements, Phong stands apart. He will never compromise on safety and will tell you when a full replacement is necessary, but he's also straightforward and honest about when it isn't.\n\nThere have been multiple occasions where I received an inflated quote from another shop, only for Phong to provide a much more reasonable estimate. His work is top-notch, and his expert knowledge is evident in every service. What truly sets him apart is his honesty\u2014he will only recommend repairs or maintenance that are absolutely necessary. If you're on a budget, he\u2019s also willing to suggest more affordable alternatives to OEM parts, which we greatly appreciate.\n\nEven though his prices are fair, Phong\u2019s professionalism and attention to detail easily rival, and often exceed, what you\u2019d find at high-end corporate shops. I highly recommend SM Auto for anyone looking for quality service with integrity.",
